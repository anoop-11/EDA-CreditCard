##### • Title:- Credit Card Defaulter Analysis
##### • Tool Used :
##### (i).  EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 
##### (ii). Python with Python Libraries - (Pandas , Matplotlib , Seaborn) 

## Description :
##### • Gold Atlantis , a credit-providing firm, observed a rise in the number of defaulters. Now, the firm is only interested in those consumers who have a lower probability of becoming a defaulter.
##### • However , there are two types of risks that are associated with the firm’s decisions.

###### • If the applicant is likely to repay the loan , then disapproving the loan may result in a loss of business to the firm.
###### • If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, that is if the applicant is a defaulter, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss to the form.

## Approach :
##### • Understanding the Data
##### • Data Pre-Processing
##### • Data Cleaning
##### • Performing EDA : Level 0 - Understanding | Level 1 - Univariate | Level 2 - Bi-Variate | Level 3 - Multi-Variate
##### • Data Analysing by EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using Python with Python Libraries - (Pandas , Matplotlib , Seaborn).
##### • Data Visulaization by Using Python Libraries - ( Matplotlib , Seaborn )
